# Advent of Code 2024

I plan to solve the puzzles in Deno.

## Work Log

This is a stream-of-thoughts as I work.

Day 1: This is my first time actually solving AoC puzzles, though I've perused solutions in past years. I started out setting up a helper class to do stuff common to each puzzle. After doing 2 puzzles, I'm seeing this is going to be as little more quick-and-dirty. I probably won't even label the output nicely; just get the answer and move on.

Tomorrow I might take bit more functional approach.

I've been working on constrained devices lately, and that had me looking for a Deno file lines iterator to see if I can do some of these, where possible, without loading all the data into the RAM.
